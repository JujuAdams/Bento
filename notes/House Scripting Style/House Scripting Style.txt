Bento's scripting defaults to my particular style. This may not be to your tastes so I encourage
you to fiddle with the function names until you're content. Bento is open source for this very
reason. Please do bear in mind that really severe alterations will make it harder for me to help
debug any issues you might run into.

  1. Variable and function names should follow American US spellings.
  2. Braces must be on the same line as the if/while/build statement (this is a requiremnt of
     Catspeak in general) like so:
         if (data.christmasMode) {
             color = GetRandomChristmasColor()
         }
  3. GameMaker functions, in-built variables, and constants should use their native names in
     exception to the following rules.
  4. Any "private" variables, functions, etc. should be prefixed with __underscores.
  5. Any local variables should be prefixed with a single _underscore.
  6. Variable names should use camelCase.
  7. Function names and scripts should use PascalCase.
  8. Assets names (other than scripts) should use camelCase. 
  9. Constants, macros, and enums should use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
 10. Assets should be prefixed like so:
       Sprite:     sprSprite
       Object:     objObject
       Room:       rmRoom
       Anim Curve: acAnimCurve
       Font:       fntFont
       Sequence:   seqSequence
       Shader:     shdShader
       Sound:      sndSound
       Tile Set:   tlsTileset
       Timeline:   ??? Who uses timelines?
