The shared UI class is an internal constructor that can be accessed using the BentoClassShared() macro.
In general, you should try to build new custom constructors by inheriting from directly relevant
constructors. For example, when creating a custom button then you should inherit from BentoClassButton
rather than try to build your own functionality from BentoClassShared(). This reduces boilerplate and means
that any future updates to default library behaviour will automatically be reflected in your custom
UI constructors.

However, all default UI constructors will eventually inherit from BentoClassShared() as the sole common
ancestor. This means that all default boxes share the same basic capabilities. Below is
a list of what those capabilities are.

General utility:
  GET & SET  identifier
  GET & SET  active
  GET & SET  visible

Local coordinates (i.e. relative to parent's top-left corner):
  GET & SET  left
  GET & SET  top
  GET & SET  right
  GET & SET  bottom
  GET & SET  width
  GET & SET  height
  GET & SET  ltrb
  GET & SET  size
  GET & SET  xy

World coordinates (absolute):
  GET & SET  worldLeft
  GET & SET  worldTop
  GET & SET  worldRight
  GET & SET  worldBottom

Coordinates for use when drawing:
  GET        drawLeft
  GET        drawTop
  GET        drawRight
  GET        drawBottom

Parent/child-related variables:
  GET        parent
  GET        children
  GET        childMinLeft
  GET        childMinTop
  GET        childMaxRight
  GET        childMacBottom

Callback assignment. If used, the following must be set to functions:
        SET  callbackPress
        SET  callbackHold
        SET  callbackRelease
        SET  callbackClick
        SET  callbackCanCapture
        SET  targetListen
        SET  castListen
        SET  callbackEnter
        SET  callbackOver
        SET  callbackLeave
        SET  callbackStep
        SET  callbackDraw
        SET  callbackCanHighlight
        SET  callbackOnClose
        SET  layoutVerticalList
        SET  layoutHorizontalList
        SET  callbackLayout
        SET  callbackLayoutCheck

boxes also all have a selection of methods that can be executed:
  GetIdentifier()
  SetIdentifier()
  GetType()
  GetUUID()
  GetHighlight()
  GetButton()
  Find(identifier)
  HighlightStateSet(state)
  ButtonStateSet(state)
  VariableBind(variableName, getterFunc, setterFun)
  Get(variableName)
  Set(variableName, value)
  ReplaceFROMfile(path)
