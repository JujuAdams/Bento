Juju: Scroll regions are used to hide contents inside a parent instance. You can see an example of
      this behavior in `oPageOptions`. Scroll regions wouldn't make sense without child instances
      and you can read about parenting and child instances in the `Parenting` note.

The Gui system takes advantage of the new (for GameMaker at least) scissor test functions to create
scrollable windows. The contents of a parent (the "inside" children, please see the `Parenting`
note) can be moved within a visible rectangle on the screen. Children, or even parts of children,
that are not visible cannot be selected by the cursor. Scroll regions can be used alongside
layouts; be sure to call `GuiLayoutFinishWithScroll()` instead of `GuiLayoutFinish()`.

When using `GUI_NAV_GAMEPAD`, any hovered instance will be automatically scrolled such that it is
visible inside the window. Scroll regions respond to click-and-drag and tap-and-drag on desktop and
touchscreens respectively. Scroll regions can also respond to mouse wheel input by setting the
special `GUI_BUTTON_MOUSE_WHEEL_UP` and `GUI_BUTTON_MOUSE_WHEEL_DOWN` button inputs. These two
inputs should be set using `GuiInputButton()`. The amount that a scroll region should move when
using the mouse wheel is set by the `GUI_MOUSE_WHEEL_SCROLL_SPEED` macro.

The windowed area of a parent can be set up using one of the `GuiScrollSetRegion*()` functions.
These define what area of the parent should allow children to be drawn. Any part of children
outside the defined area will not be visible. However, the `GuiScrollSetRegion*()` functions alone
will not allow scrolling movement to happen (only clipping). You must call one of the following
functions to set up the actual scrolling movement:
 - `GuiScrollSetupVert()`
 - `GuiScrollSetupHori()`
 - `GuiScrollSetupExt()`
 - `GuiLayoutFinishWithScroll()`

Once you've set up the region and the scrolling movement, you should call `GuiScrollOnPointer()` in
User Event 1 for the parent and any children. This function will handle scrolling functionaltiy for
you. However, if you'd like to manually control scrolling then you may use the other scroll
functions to achieve whatever goal you're after.
