# Customisation

&nbsp;

As mentioned, a Bento box is implemented as a struct. Needless to say, a box is a special type of box. All boxes are generated by instantiating constructors, and those constructors all (through a chain of inheritance) inherit from the same base constructor `BentoClassShared`. Bento offers several basic UI templates ("widgets") as constructors. For example, the sprite button constructor `BentoClassSpriteButton` inherits from `BentoClassButton` which in turn inherits from `BentoClassShared`.

?> If you're not familiar with constructor inheritance, check out [GameMaker's documentation](https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FStructs.htm&rhsearch=Inheritance&rhhlterm=Inheritance) on the topic.

There's no conceivable way that I could cover every UI use case with Bento. As a result, Bento is built to be easily extensible. In order to customise Bento, all you need to do is create a new constructor and inherit from the template of your choice. If you'd like to make a special kind of slider, you can inherit from `BentoClassHorizontalSlider` and start customising. This will require some effort on your part, but it's worth it.

If you'd like to make something totally custom then you'll want to inherit directly from `BentoClassShared` and fill in the various variables and callbacks as you see fit.

You can read more about the various templates that available to you [here](Bento-Templates).
